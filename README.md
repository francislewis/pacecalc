# pacecalc
A simple pace/time/speed calculator.

The page is online at [www.francislewis.me/pacecalc](http://www.francislewis.me/pacecalc).

The page you should get, hosted at [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/francislewis/pacecalc/tree/gh-pages), is the same as the [`master`](https://github.com/francislewis/pacecalc) branch, just minified.
